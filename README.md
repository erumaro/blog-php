# blog-php

As part of the php/cms portion of the front-end developer course at Nackademin we where told to create a blog in php.
Main points being to be able to create, edit and delete from a MySql database with forms and display the content on two pages admin and a public visitor page.

If I continue developing this one I will add more security things like a login, more advanced form check and TinyMCE editor.
